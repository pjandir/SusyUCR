   The workflow is
     1) Fill histograms in fine analysis bins with (skimmed) reduced trees as input.
     2) Make flattened 1D plots using histograms.
     3) Generate likelihood builder input flat file from histograms.
     4) Build a RooStats workspace from the input flat file.
     5) Run statistical code using workspace as input.

   Here are the details.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 1) Fill histograms in fine analysis bins with (skimmed) reduced trees as input.

   Code:    fill_bg_hists2.c and fill_sig_hists2.c
   Input:   reducedTree root files in the directory (or symbolic link dir) current-reducedTree-dir
   Output:  outputfiles/fill-bg-hists2.root and outputfiles/fill-sig-hists2.root

   Make a symbolic link to your reduced tree directory like this before running:
     ln -s <your-dir>  current-reducedTree-dir

   Then, load and run fill_bg_hists2.c and fill_sig_hists2.c

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 2) Make flattened 1D plots using histograms.

   Code:   draw_bg_hists2.c and draw_bgsig_hists2.c
   Input:  outputfiles/fill-bg-hists2.root and outputfiles/fill-sig-hists2.root
   Output: outputfiles/fill-bg-hists2-postdraw.root, outputfiles/fill-bg-hists2-*-postdraw.root,
           and a crapload of pdf files where * is one of: t1bbbbH, t1bbbbC, t1ttttH, t1ttttC,
           t1qqqqH, t1qqqqC

   Optional: bg-hist-plots.tex and bgsig-hist-plots.tex

   See the arguments of draw_bg_hists2.c and draw_bgsig_hists2.c
   You need to run draw_bgsig_hists2.c six times, once for each signal sample, changing
   the third argument to one of t1bbbbH, t1bbbbC, t1ttttH, t1ttttC, t1qqqqH, t1qqqqC.

   If you pdflatex bg-hist-plots.tex and bgsig-hist-plots.tex, you will get a nice summary of
   the plots in pdf files.  Note that it uses the finer binning scheme.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 3) Generate likelihood builder input flat file from histograms.

   Code:   make_lhbuilder_input2.c and setup_lhbuilder_inputs.c
   Input:  outputfiles/fill-bg-hists2-t1bbbbH-postdraw.root or replace t1bbbbH with another signal.
   Output: outputfiles/lhbuilder-input-t1bbbbH.txt or replace t1bbbbH with another signal.

   See the arguments of make_lhbuilder_input2.c.  Right now, this only includes QCD, lost leptons,
   and signal.  The file setup_lhbuilder_inputs.c runs make_lhbuilder_input2.c for the six
   SMS test samples.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 4) Build a RooStats workspace from the input flat file.

   Code:   wrapper_build_ra2b_ws2.c  (guts is in build_ra2b_ws2.c) and setup_ws_files.c
      (Depends on this code: RooPoissonLogEval.*, RooProdPdfLogSum.*)
   Input:  outputfiles/lhbuilder-input-t1bbbbH.txt or replace t1bbbbH with another signal.
   Output: outputfiles/ws-t1bbbbH.root or replace t1bbbbH with another signal.

   Load the wrapper_build_ra2b_ws2.c without compiling.  The real code will be compiled.
   See the arguments of wrapper_build_ra2b_ws2.c or build_ra2b_ws2.c (they are the same).
   It is set up to save CPU by only including search bins where the signal fraction,
   at the nominal cross section or a signal strength of 1, is above some minimum value
   set by the min_signal_frac argument.  You can optinally save all search bins with
   zero-lepton counts below the saveall_below_N argument value, regardless of the signal
   fraction.

   The file setup_ws_files.c runs wrapper_build_ra2b_ws2.c on the six SMS test samples.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 5) Run statistical code using workspace as input.

   Code:    significance_by_sb.c, scan_signalstrength.c, scan_sigstrength_single_sb.c, and run_significance.c
   Input:   outputfiles/ws-t1bbbbH.root or replace t1bbbbH with another signal.
   Output:  outputfiles/signal-strength-scan-t1bbbbH.pdf and outputfiles/signal-strength-scan-t1bbbbH.root
            outputfiles/significance-per-bin-t1bbbbH.pdf

   significance_by_sb.c
     Evaluates significance from delta log likelihood at zero signal strength for each search
     bin individually and evaluates a derived combined significance.  This is reasonably fast
     and can be run for all search bins (no need to filter out low significance ones).
     run_significance.c runs significance_by_sb.c for the six SMS test points.

   scan_signalstrength.c and scan_sigstrength_single_sb.c
     Does a profile likelihood scan of the signal strength for the given RooStats workspace.
     The signal significance is the square root of the scan value at a signal strength of zero.
