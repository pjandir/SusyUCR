   The workflow is
     1) Fill histograms in fine analysis bins with (skimmed) reduced trees as input.
     2) Make flattened 1D plots using histograms.
     3) Generate likelihood builder input flat file from histograms.
     4) Build a RooStats workspace from the input flat file.
     5) Run the QCD likelihood fit.
     6) Run statistical code using workspace as input.

   Here are the details.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 1) Fill histograms in fine analysis bins with (skimmed) reduced trees as input.

   Code:    fill_bg_hists4.c and fill_sig_hists4.c and do_step1a.c and do_step1b.c
   Input:   reducedTree root files in the directory (or symbolic link dir) current-reducedTree-dir
   Output:  outputfiles/fill-bg-hists4.root and outputfiles/fill-sig-hists4.root
            outputfiles/fill-bg-hists4-nbsum.root and outputfiles/fill-sig-hists4-nbsum.root

   Make a symbolic link to your reduced tree directory like this before running:
     ln -s <your-dir>  current-reducedTree-dir

   Then, load and run fill_bg_hists4.c and fill_sig_hists4.c
   Run each one twice, once with sum_over_nb = false, once with sum_over_nb = true.
   The sum over nb version is for the qcd likelihood fit.

   *** To do a standard setup, just use do_step1a.c and do_step1b.c


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 2) Make flattened 1D plots using histograms.

   Code:   draw_bg_hists4.c and draw_bgsig_hists4.c and do_step2.c
   Input:  outputfiles/fill-bg-hists4.root and outputfiles/fill-sig-hists4.root
           outputfiles/fill-bg-hists4-nbsum.root and outputfiles/fill-sig-hists4-nbsum.root
   Output: outputfiles/fill-bg-hists4-postdraw.root, outputfiles/fill-bg-hists4-*-postdraw.root,
           outputfiles/fill-bg-hists4-nbsum-postdraw.root, outputfiles/fill-bg-hists4-nbsum-*-postdraw.root,
           and a crapload of pdf files where * is one of: t1bbbbH, t1bbbbC, t1ttttH, t1ttttC,
           t1qqqqH, t1qqqqC

   Optional: bg-hist-plots.tex and bgsig-hist-plots.tex

   See the arguments of draw_bg_hists4.c and draw_bgsig_hists4.c
   You need to run draw_bgsig_hists4.c six times, once for each signal sample, changing
   the third argument to one of t1bbbbH, t1bbbbC, t1ttttH, t1ttttC, t1qqqqH, t1qqqqC.

   If you pdflatex bg-hist-plots.tex and bgsig-hist-plots.tex, you will get a nice summary of
   the plots in pdf files.  Note that it uses the finer binning scheme.

   *** To do a standard setup, just use do_step2.c

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 3) Generate likelihood builder input flat file from histograms.

   Code:   make_lhbuilder_input4b.c and do_step3.c
   Input:  outputfiles/fill-bg-hists4-t1bbbbH-postdraw.root or replace t1bbbbH with another signal.
           outputfiles/fill-bg-hists4-t1bbbbH-nbsum-postdraw.root or replace t1bbbbH with another signal.
   Output: outputfiles/lhbuilder-input-v4b-nonperfect-closure-ss0-nbsum-t1bbbbH-qcdlhfit.txt
           outputfiles/lhbuilder-input-v4b-nonperfect-closure-ss1-fullfit-t1bbbbH.txt

   See the arguments of make_lhbuilder_input4b.c.  Right now, this only includes QCD, lost leptons,
   and signal.  To make the input for the QCD likelihood fit in the fine bins, use the nbsum input
   root file, set true_sig_strength to zero, and use setup_qcdlhfit = true.

   Warning: If you are NOT doing the QCD likelihood fit for the model parameters (K factors), then
   you need to set the values and uncertainties of the K parameters in the beginning of
   make_lhbuilder_input4b.c by hand before running it.  These should either come from the
   QCD chi2 fit or the QCD likelihood fit.

   *** To do a standard setup, just use do_step3.c

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 4) Build a RooStats workspace from the input flat file.

   Code:   wrapper_build_ra2b_ws4b.c  (guts is in build_ra2b_ws4b.c) and do_step4.c
      (Depends on this code: RooPoissonLogEval.*, RooProdPdfLogSum.*)
   Input: outputfiles/lhbuilder-input-v4b-nonperfect-closure-ss0-nbsum-t1bbbbH-qcdlhfit.txt
          outputfiles/lhbuilder-input-v4b-nonperfect-closure-ss1-fullfit-t1bbbbH.txt
   Output: outputfiles/ws-v4b-t1bbbbH-nonperfect-closure-nbsum-qcdlhfit.root
           outputfiles/ws-v4b-t1bbbbH-nonperfect-closure-ss1-fullfit.root

   Load the wrapper_build_ra2b_ws4b.c without compiling.  The real code will be compiled.
   See the arguments of wrapper_build_ra2b_ws4b.c or build_ra2b_ws4b.c (they are the same).
   It is set up to save CPU by only including search bins where the signal fraction,
   at the nominal cross section or a signal strength of 1, is above some minimum value
   set by the min_signal_frac argument.  You can optinally save all search bins with
   zero-lepton counts below the saveall_below_N argument value, regardless of the signal
   fraction.

   *** To do a standard setup, just use do_step4.c

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  5) Run the QCD likelihood fit.

   Code:   qcdfit.c
   Input:  outputfiles/lhbuilder-input-v4b-nonperfect-closure-ss0-nbsum-t1bbbbH-qcdlhfit.txt

   The 2nd and 3rd argments are fix_nuisance_pars and fix_bg_mu_pars.  Try it with both
   true first.

   Note:  You may want to take the QCD likelihood fit results and use them to update
   the hardwired qcd_k*_val and qcd_k*err values at the top of make_lhbuilder_input4b
   and rerun steps 3 and 4.  It's probably better to instead use the QCD chi2 fit results.

   If you run this on a workspace set up with perfect closure for the QCD LH fit,
   it will give you an estimate for how well the QCD LH fit will be able to determine
   the Kqcd parameters.  Note that the values should agree very well with the kqcd numbers
   set in make_lhbuilder_input4b.c, since the event counts were computed with these.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 6) Run statistical code using workspace as input.

   Code:    significance_by_sb.c, scan_signalstrength.c, scan_sigstrength_single_sb.c, and run_significance.c
   Input:   outputfiles/ws-t1bbbbH.root or replace t1bbbbH with another signal.
   Output:  outputfiles/signal-strength-scan-t1bbbbH.pdf and outputfiles/signal-strength-scan-t1bbbbH.root
            outputfiles/significance-per-bin-t1bbbbH.pdf

   significance_by_sb.c
     Evaluates significance from delta log likelihood at zero signal strength for each search
     bin individually and evaluates a derived combined significance.  This is reasonably fast
     and can be run for all search bins (no need to filter out low significance ones).
     run_significance.c runs significance_by_sb.c for the six SMS test points.

   scan_signalstrength.c and scan_sigstrength_single_sb.c
     Does a profile likelihood scan of the signal strength for the given RooStats workspace.
     The signal significance is the square root of the scan value at a signal strength of zero.
