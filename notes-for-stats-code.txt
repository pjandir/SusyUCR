   The workflow is
     1) Fill histograms in fine analysis bins with (skimmed) reduced trees as input.
     2) Make flattened 1D plots using histograms.
     3) Generate likelihood builder input flat file from histograms.
     4) Build a RooStats workspace from the input flat file.
     5) Run statistical code using workspace as input.

   Here are the details.

 1) Fill histograms in fine analysis bins with (skimmed) reduced trees as input.

   Code: fill_bg_hists2.c and fill_sig_hists2.c

   Make a symbolic link to your reduced tree directory like this before running:
     ln -s <your-dir>  current-reducedTree-dir
